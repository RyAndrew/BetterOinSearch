Performing a discrete action on each item without returning anything to the Parent Flow is very common, as well as, keeping a cumulative output of each item iteration that can be returned to the Parent Flow. There are many other List operations. Check our in app documentation for details. Child Flows are simply subroutines that exist as a separate flow but can only be called from a main or Parent Flow.
